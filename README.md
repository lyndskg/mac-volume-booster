## Project Overview
<ins>__*volume-vault*__</ins> is a macOS application that breaks through Apple's pre-set maximum audio playback volume restrictions, allowing users to boost their audio by up to 2000%. 

This entertaining project features a simple and minimalistic user interface, offering users the choice to use it as a Mac menu bar drop-down widget or a standalone application for an enjoyable audio amplification experience.


<a name="obj"></a>
### Objectives
The main objective of <ins>__*volume-vault*__</ins> is to provide macOS users with a playful solution to amplify their audio volume beyond the limitations imposed by Apple. By offering a user-friendly interface and a humorous touch, VolumeVault aims to enhance the audio experience for users who desire louder sound without compromising on quality.

<a name="tech"></a>
## Technologies and Programming Languages
For the front-end and UI development, the following technologies and programming languages are recommended:

Swift: As the primary language for macOS app development.
SwiftUI: To create a modern and visually appealing minimalistic user interface.
For the back-end and audio processing, the following library can be considered:

Core Audio: For audio manipulation and volume boosting.

---------------------
<a name="map"></a>
## Roadmap

UI Design: Design a simple and visually appealing user interface, considering both the menu bar widget and standalone application.
Implement Volume Boosting: Integrate Core Audio to enable volume boosting beyond Apple's pre-set maximum volume.
Configure UI Controls: Add sliders, buttons, or other controls to allow users to adjust the volume and enable/disable the volume boost.
Menu Bar Integration: Implement the functionality to run the application as a menu bar widget with a dropdown interface.
Standalone Application: Create a separate standalone application with the same functionality and minimal UI.
User Preferences: Allow users to customize settings, such as preferred volume levels or startup behavior.
Testing: Perform rigorous testing to ensure smooth functionality and handle potential edge cases.
Code Optimization: Refine the codebase and optimize performance for a seamless user experience.
Deployment: Prepare the application for distribution on the Mac App Store.

## Basic Workflow Guide

Upon launching <ins>__*volume-vault*__</ins>, the user is presented with a clean and straightforward UI, either as a menu bar widget or a standalone application.
The user can toggle the volume boost feature on/off using a button or checkbox.
A slider allows the user to adjust the level of volume boost they desire, ranging from 0% to 2000%.
The application utilizes Core Audio to intercept audio output and apply the desired volume boost.
The boosted audio is then sent to the system's audio output for playback.
The user can control the volume directly from the application or the menu bar widget.

## Basic I/O Details

Input:
User interaction with the application's sliders and buttons to control volume boost and other settings.
Output:
Boosted audio output to the system's audio playback.


System/User Permissions and Requirements:
To manipulate audio output, VolumeVault will need appropriate permissions to access the user's audio settings and intercept audio playback. Users will need to grant the necessary permissions during the application's first run. <ins>__*volume-vault*__</ins> should adhere to macOS security guidelines and handle permissions gracefully.
